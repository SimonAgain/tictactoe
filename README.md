Project # 0. Tic Tac Toe.

First project for General Assembly’s Software Engineering Intensive group 37.

Project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript to create Tic Tac Toe.

This version classic implementation of Tic Tac Toe with "0"s and "X"s.

Instructions:

* A working version of the project can be found here. [link to game](http://SimonAgain.github.io/tictactoe

* The player who places their icon in a straight line on 3 consecutive squares, wins.

* Players can choose between two player mode or single player mode by selecting "Start Challenge" or "Challenge AI" respectively.

* During game play or once result has been reached, a player can opt to "Play Again" or "Reset Game", by pressing those buttons accordingly.

* The game score is tracked when playing consecutive games. The looser of the previous game will take the first move of the next game.

Reflection:

The project has been a great learning experience and I look forward to further challenging projects. A takeaway for me from this project is to plan the project before coding. I took the attitude of delivering a minimal viable product with the intention of improving my code and design at a later state. Although providing a minimal viable product is sound, I took it too far in this instance. Once too far down the path, there wasn’t the time to remodel the project. A more thought out design could have allowed for expansion and versatile extras. Still a great learning experience..

Knows bugs/annoyances:
* Game board buttons show a dot once “Play Again” or “Reset Score” has been pressed.
    * This is caused but needing a hidden character in place in order to place the “X” or “0”. Without a character  already in place, the boxes of the game board would pop out of position when placing the player’s symbol..
	  * The use of “button” to make up the game board and the way in which wrote an X or 0 to that button, could be the cause. I would like to try using another method to add boxes to the game board as well as overlaying an image to the location as the symbol rather than “writing” character to that location.
* Future versions hope involve animation.
